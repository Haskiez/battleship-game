Once you have shot your cannonball the computer will go and so on and so forth.</li>

                                <li class="info-text">Deciding where to shoot can be a tough decision. If you choose wrong, that could be end of the game! So choose wisely. Each shot you take on your opponents board will show either gray or red. If the square is gray, then that means you have previously shot there and it considered a miss. If the square is red then that is a shot you took previously that was a hit.</li>
                                <li class="info-text">A miss is pretty straightforward. The square you guessed was not a place where your opponenets ship was. A hit is the opposite. This square designates one part of the ship that is on your opponenets game board.</li>
                                <li class="info-text"><strong>Quick Tip:</strong> Since ships can't be placed diagonally, when you get a hit, go ahead and shoot around that spot. You are bound to get another hit eventually and you can follow that straight line to sink the ship.</li>

                                <li class="info-text">Winning the game is fairly simple, just sink all your opponents ships! You do this by calling shots and being strategic! Two of the best strategies are, first, getting in your opponenets head to think like them and know where they would have placed their ships, and the second, is to think mathmatically.</li>
