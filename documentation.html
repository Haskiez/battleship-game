            <h2>Game Documentation</h2>
            <a href="index.html" style="margin-left: auto;"><img src="icons/logo.ico" height="50px" width="50px" alt="Battleship Logo"></a>
        </div>
        <div class="sub-container">
            <p><strong>10 points</strong> - Documentation explaining how you implemented your game and how it satisfies the remainder of the requirements. The documentation should be in a file named documentation.html, with a link to the documentation file on the project description page.</p>
            <p> This page you are looking at is the fulfillment of this requirement!</p>
        </div>
        <div class="sub-container">
            <p><strong>20 points</strong> - Game grid that uses CSS and is generated by JavaScript.</p>
            <p> This is generated by game-grid.js file which is the javascript part of the view for that page.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="sub-container">
            <p><strong>20 points</strong> - User input in the form of text, select options, and/or buttons.</p>
            <p> The user will encountered text boxes and buttons. The first textboxes are encountered when you sign up for the game. This part just asks for your name and the username you want to go by. Just for fun. You can really put anything you want there. The reset button on the game grid page will reset the game but not the score.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="sub-container">
            <p><strong>20 points</strong> - User input in the form of mouse clicks.</p>
            <p> This is actually most of the game. To play the game you have to click the game board.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="sub-container">
            <p><strong>20 points</strong> - Dynamic modification of HTML using innerHTML or DOM functions.</p>
            <p> This requirement is used constantly to update the view for the game. Especially the alert boxes for the player and the computer.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="sub-container">
            <p><strong>20 points</strong> - Use of XMLHttpRequest to load JSON or XML game data that is displayed on the grid page.</p>
            <p> I know how to do this but I could not think of a single think I'd want to load. I tried to load a saved game in the last assignemnt but you said that didn't work so I didn't have any idea what to do here...</p>
        </div>
        <div class="sub-container">
            <p><strong>20 points</strong> - Incorporates HTML 5 audio tags, video tags, canvas, or local storage.</p>
            <p> So I Incorporated a embeded video that explains the idea of the game if you didn't want to read it or go to the official rules link.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="sub-container">
            <p><strong>120 points</strong> - Game logic code.</p>
            <p> This is evident in the playable game. Honestly this is also my most proud piece of this project. It took me a long time to get the AI for the computer to be pretty smart. There are a few adjustments I could have made but it took me to the wire to complete this project as it is. This code can all be found in the model.js file.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="sub-container">
            <p><strong>EXTRA 20 points</strong> - Include a second HTML5 component. If your first HTML5 component is media (audio or video) then your second component can't be a media component.</p>
            <p> I tried implementing local storage but I literally couldn't think of anything to do for it. So my brother said he'd like to just be able to have some recongnition that he is playing so I allowed this sign on feature that is stored in local storage.</p>
